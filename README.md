# PPE_rationalizer
We are a group of students and recent graduates of IIT Kharagpur who have come together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in India under our initiative COMBAT COVID-19. We have partnered with Dakshas to achieve our goals.

The rapid spread of COVID-19 has critically overwhelmed healthcare institutions around the world, Confronted with drastic supply shortages, safety of patient care and the healthcare workers is equally threatened, especially in personal protective equipment (PPE). Our application predicts the amount of PPE required by tapping into predictive models, using rational as specified by the WHO guidelines, encapsulated in a web based application, with an interactive dashboard to analyze longevity and plan distribution strategy, integrating into purchase management. A few salient features include:
1. Easy to use interface -  
~ Easy input of parameters: Total staff, role, their capacity and expected patients
~ Easy visualization of demand and scenarios
~ Easily downloadable 
2. Options to personalize the model 
3. Situation based budgeting - Exact demand based on different situations like OPD vs ICU 
4. Transparent process of estimating demand- We would provide links to the WHO and Indian governmentâ€™s guidelines which have been used to calculate the demand
